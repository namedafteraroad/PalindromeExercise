//Create a class named WordSmith in your PalindromeExercise project file. This is where you will eventually create your IsAPalindrome() method

//In your WordSmith class, you will create a method (IsAPalindrome) that will take a parameter of type string and return a value of type bool.
//If the given input is a palindrome – return true, else return false. You will finish this method after you write your tests.

//Write you test method in the UnitTest1.cs file - located in the PalindromeExerciseTests project file

//In UnitTest1.cs, remove the Fact portion and replace it with:

//[Theory]
//[InlineData()] // ← you will need to put some test data and expected result here.  

//// For example [InlineData(“racecar”, true)]
//Finish the test with Arrange, Act, Assert and make your IsAPalindrome method pass the tests
//Once finished, save, commit, and push back to Github
